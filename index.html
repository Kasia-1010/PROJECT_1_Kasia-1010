  <p>Colorful Thoughts</p>
  
<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue; Eyes of blue></h1>
  <p> What is the first a human and child of light does?</p>
  <p>You can feel the pigments spent on the canvas.</p>
  <p>As you do the white and soft background turns into a river of fresh paint</p>

  <p>very past the laughs on her face when asked to leave</p>
  <p>pigments runs down the canvas</p>
  <p>Enslave, a Desire to be Free</p>
 <p>She is a hound, a sick bitch</p>

  <p>flowers the living and flash by her rotten flesh.</p>
  <p> Sick not in the flesh but in the mind,</p>
  <p>very living and pleasant to the eye with wondering colors but in a controlled manner.</p>
  <p>figure could be your mind playing tricks on you.</p>

  <p>the sorrows that her heart can bear.</p>
  <p>colorful figure with how grand he is.</p>
   <p> Thunder the blues and the flash of white.</p>
  <p>fallen angel who has lost their way and now and only now has the chance to climb the staircase to the heavens.</p>

  <p>Redemption</p>
<p>One by one the screaning of the acne from their lips.</p>
  <p>the echos of sorrow.</p>
   <p> Thoughts may wander into different shapes and figures.</p>
   <p> In the flesh but in the mind,</p>

  <p>Sprilled through him and with him.‚Äù</p>
<p>One eye is open and one eye can see while the other is blind.</p>
  <p>Parasitic Wisdom</p>
   <p>Enslave, a Desire to be Free</p>
