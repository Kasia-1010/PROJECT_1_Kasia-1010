Colorful Thoughts
  Eyes of blue
  what is the first a human, and child of light does? 
  You can feel the pigments spent on the canvas. 
  As you do the white and soft background turns into a river of fresh paint
  very past the laughs on her face when asked to leave
  pigments runs down the canvas 
  Enslave, a Desire to be Free
 She is a hound, a sick bitch 
  flowers the living and flash by her rotten flesh.
  sick not in the flesh but in the mind,
  very living and pleasant to the eye with wondering colors but in a controlled manner. 
  figure could be your mind playing tricks on you.
   the sorrows that her heart can bear. 
  colorful figure with how grand he is. 
   thunder the blues and the flash of white.
  fallen angel who has lost their way and now and only now has the chance to climb the staircase to the heavens.
  Redemption
One by one the screaning of the acne from their lips.
  the echos of sorrow. 
   thoughts may wander into different shapes and figures. 
   in the flesh but in the mind,
  Sprilled through him and with him.‚Äù
One eye is open and one eye can see while the other is blind.
