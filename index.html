  <p> What is the first a human and child of light does?</p>
  <p>You can feel the pigments spent on the canvas.</p>
  <p>As you do the white and soft background turns into a river of fresh paint</p> <div>

   <h1 <p>very past the laughs on her face when asked to leave</p>,/h1>
  <p>pigments runs down the canvas</p>
  <p>Enslave, a Desire to be Free</p>
 <p>She is a hound, a sick dog</p> <div>

  <div> <p>flowers the living and flesh by her rotten flesh.</p>
  <p> Sick not in the flesh but in the mind,</p>
  <p>very living and pleasant to the eye with wondering colors but in a controlled manner.</p>
  <p>figure could be your mind playing tricks on you.</p> <div>

    <img src="she.jpg" alt="she.jpg">

  <div> <p>the sorrows that her heart can bear.</p>
  <p>colorful figure with how grand he is.</p>
   <p> Thunder the blues and the flash of white.</p>
  <p>fallen angel who has lost their way and now and only now has the chance to climb the staircase to the heavens.</p> <div>

  <div> <p>Redemption</p>
<p>One by one the screaning of the acne from their lips.</p>
  <p>the echos of sorrow.</p>
   <p> Thoughts may wander into different shapes and figures.</p>
   <p> In the flesh but in the mind,</p> <div>

   <div><p>Sprilled through him and with him.‚Äù</p>
